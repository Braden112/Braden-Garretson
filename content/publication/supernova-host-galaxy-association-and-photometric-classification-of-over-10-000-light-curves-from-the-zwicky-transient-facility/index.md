abstract: Here we present a catalog of 12,993 photometrically-classified
  supernova-like light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, along with
  candidate host galaxy associations. By training a random forest classifier on
  spectroscopically classified supernovae from the Bright Transient Survey, we
  achieve an accuracy of 80% across four supernova classes resulting in a final
  data set of 8208 Type Ia, 2080 Type II, 1985 Type Ib/c, and 720 SLSN. Our work
  represents a pathfinder effort to supply massive data sets of supernova light
  curves with value-added information that can be used to enable
  population-scale modeling of explosion parameters and investigate host galaxy
  environments.
